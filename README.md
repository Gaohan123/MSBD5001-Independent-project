# MSBD5001-Independent-project
The repo is for MSBD5001 independent project from Gao Han (Student id: 20565848)

## Programming Language
Here I just use python 3 to train the model and make prediction.

## Required Packages
Here all packages are based on Python. They are:
* pandas
* sklearn
* math
* pickle

## Required Files
* All files in this repository are required to run prediction.py
* If you want to test with a new dataset, just replace 'test.csv' 
file with your new csv file and run 'prediction.py'.

## Outcome
The result generated by 'prediction.py' is also listed here. It
is 'submission_hgaoaf.csv', which can be submitted to kaggle 
directly.
